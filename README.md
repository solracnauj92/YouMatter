## Inspiration
Welcome to "You Matter" – a project in mental health support and community connection, representing a significant milestone in my 4th project for Code Institute. Imagine a space where understanding thrives, and empathy transforms challenges into triumphs. As a mental health practitioner, for me this isn’t just a  website development; it's about the people. 

# Agile Kanban Pre Planning 
Despite careful planning, the project did not unfold as intended. Unfortunately, the implementation of Django did not proceed as expected, despite having two different drafts.

## User Persona

In this section, I used UserPersona.dev free AI-powered User Persona Generator. By offering a concise description, it generates insightful user personas. The narratives presented below are inspired by real-life struggles, with due consideration given to privacy and protection through the alteration of names, locations, image and ages. 

- Story 1: Sarah (Teenager)

Sarah is a 17-year-old high school student who has been struggling with social anxiety. She often felt isolated and overwhelmed in crowded social situations, which affected her academic performance and overall well-being. One day, she stumbled upon the "You Matter" website, where she found articles and self-help resources specifically tailored to teenagers facing similar challenges. She joined a support group and gradually built the confidence to share her experiences. Through the encouragement and guidance of the group, Sarah learned strategies to manage her anxiety and discovered that she wasn't alone in her struggles. Today, Sarah is thriving in school and is excited about the future, thanks to the support and resources she found on the website.

Michael, a 35-year-old working professional, had been dealing with work-related stress, anxiety, and burnout for years. He felt overwhelmed and on the brink of quitting his job. After a particularly tough week, he decided to search for mental health support online and came across the "You Matter" website. The resources on stress management, work-life balance, and burnout prevention resonated with him. He started using the self-assessment tools and strategies provided, which helped him regain control over his mental health. Michael also found an online support group for professionals in similar situations. With the support and insights he gained from the community, he made significant changes in his life and career, ultimately finding a better work-life balance and improved mental well-being.

- Story 3: Margaret (Retired Senior)

Margaret, an 80-year-old retiree, had been feeling increasingly lonely and anxious after losing her spouse and dealing with the challenges of aging. She discovered the "You Matter" website through her grandson and found a wealth of resources tailored to seniors facing mental health issues. The website provided information on coping with grief and isolation and tips for maintaining emotional well-being in later life. Margaret also joined an online seniors' support group where she met fellow retirees facing similar challenges. The connections she made and the compassionate discussions helped her combat her feelings of loneliness and find joy in her golden years. Margaret's experience demonstrates that it's never too late to seek support and that "You Matter" is there for people of all ages.
